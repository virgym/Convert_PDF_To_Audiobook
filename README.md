# PDF to Audiobook Converter

This project is a Python-based web application that converts PDF documents into audiobooks using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. The application leverages the `pyttsx3` library for TTS, `pypdf` for extracting text from PDFs, and `Gradio` for building an easy-to-use interface.

## Features

- **PDF to Audio Conversion**: Upload any PDF document, and the app will convert it into an audiobook.
- **Voice Selection**: Choose between a male and female voice for the narration.
- **Downloadable Output**: The generated audiobook is available for download in MP3 format.
